## Presentation ##
Cards are versatile and may be used to present a wide variety of content in many
diverse contexts. Common use cases include serving as navigational elements in a 
[Hub & Spoke navigation pattern](/templates/hub-and-spoke-navigation) or as 
preview content in [dashboards](/templates/dashboards).

### A Uniform Collection ###
When presenting a set of Cards, they should be thought of as a uniform, 
homogenous collection belonging to the same 'family.' This establishes a consistent 
information hierarchy helping users quickly find, process, and act on the content 
presented.

Cards may be executed as [many styled variants](#variants), however, avoid mixing variant 
styles in any single collection.

### Layout ###
Present Cards in a responsive [grid](/components/grid) whose columns and rows adjust to 
various screens widths.

### Contents & Interactivity ###
Think focussed and concise. Each Card's content should concern a single subject. Its 
objective serves as content preview allowing users to quickly find information and act 
by drilling into the contents' greater detail. 

Each Card should be limited to a single action and be thought of as a large [button](/components/button).

## Variants ##
The following variants are meant to showcase a Card's versatility. Mix and match 
variant elements to unleash your creativity.

### Simple Identifier ###
Contains an "identifier" composed of a title and a subtitle or brief description.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsSimpleExample.js"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsSimpleExample />
</Example>

### Image Identifier ###
Including an image with a Card's identifier improves the scan-ability of a collection 
of cards by aiding the user's ability to quickly identify content of interest.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsImageIdentifierExample.js"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsImageIdentifierExample />
</Example>

### Icon Identifier ###
Including an icon with a Card's identifier improves the scan-ability of a collection 
of cards by aiding the user's ability to quickly identify content of interest.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsIconIdentifierExample.js"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsIconIdentifierExample />
</Example>

### Vertical Icon Identifier ###
Visual design flexibility delivering same user benefits as [icon identifier](#icon-identifier).

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsIconIdentifierVertExample.js"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsIconIdentifierVertExample />
</Example>

### With Footer ###
A card's footer allows for secondary information to be presented alongside the card's 
primary content. The footer is a great place to display status or other related metadata.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsFooterExample.js"
  figma="https://www.figma.com/file/je5AYzMavRt1cG7rmw8j1W/HPE-Card-Component?node-id=1%3A2"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsFooterExample />
</Example>

### With Color ###

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsColorExample.js"
  figma="https://www.figma.com/file/je5AYzMavRt1cG7rmw8j1W/HPE-Card-Component?node-id=1%3A2"
  template
