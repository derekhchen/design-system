Cards are versatile and may be used to present a wide variety of content in many
diverse contexts. Common use cases include serving as navigational elements in a 
[Hub & Spoke navigation pattern](/templates/hub-and-spoke-navigation) or as 
preview content in [dashboards](/templates/dashboards).

## Collections ##
Guidance pertaining to how to present a group of cards.

### Uniform & Scannable ###
When presenting a set of Cards, they should be thought of as a uniform, 
homogenous collection belonging to the same 'family.' This establishes a consistent 
information hierarchy helping users quickly find, process, and act on the content 
presented.

Cards may be executed as [many styled variants](#variants), however, avoid mixing variant 
styles in any single collection.

### Layouts ###
Present Cards in a [grid](/components/grid) or rows which allow card collections 
to scale gracefully and present across screens widths.

#### Cards in Responsive Grid ####

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsInGridExample.js"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsInGridExample />
</Example>

#### Cards in Responsive Row ####

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsInRowExample.js"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsInRowExample />
</Example>

#### As a Dashboard ####
Cards fit dashboard contexts nicely as they are designed to succinctly present information 
and serve as an entry point to drill into greater detail.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardsDashboardExample.js"
  template
  width="100%"
>
  <CardsDashboardExample />
</Example>

**Filtering and Sorting**

## Contents & Interactivity ##
Think focussed and concise. Each Card's content should concern a single subject. Its 
objective serves as content preview allowing users to quickly find information and act 
by drilling into the content's greater detail.

### Actions ###
- A card's primary action should represent the largest click/touch area on the card. 
- When a card has a single action, the entire card shoule be thought of as a large [button](/components/button)
leading to the content's detail screen. 
- If a card has secondary actions such as favoriting, sharing, etc. the actions should be 
placed in the card's header or footer, while the main body should be reserved for the card's 
primary action.

### Behavior ###

Focus, Elevation, Hover

### Sizes ###
### Controls ###
### Anatomy ###
