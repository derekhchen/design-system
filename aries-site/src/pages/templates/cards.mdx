## Presentation ##
Cards are versatile and may be used to present a wide variety of content in many
diverse contexts. Common use cases include serving as navigational elements in a 
[Hub & Spoke navigation pattern](/templates/hub-and-spoke-navigation) or as 
preview content in [dashboards](/templates/dashboards).

### A Uniform Collection ###
When presenting a set of Cards, they should be thought of as a uniform, 
homogenous collection belonging to the same 'family.' This establishes a consistent 
information hierarchy helping users quickly find, process, and act on the content 
presented.

Cards may be executed as [many styled variants](#variants), however, avoid mixing variant 
styles in any single collection.

### Layout ###
Present Cards in a responsive [grid](/components/grid) whose columns and rows adjust to 
various screens widths.

### Contents & Interactivity ###
Think focussed and concise. Each Card's content should concern a single subject. Its 
objective serves as content preview allowing users to quickly find information and act 
by drilling into the contents' greater detail. 

Each Card should be limited to a single action and be thought of as a large [button](/components/button).
